                wear, it may have only the slightest of marks from handling.

                A few minor scuffs/scratches. This has been played, but handled
                with good care - and certainly not
                abused.Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Slight wear, marks,
                indentations, it may possibly have a cut-out hole (or similar).

                Quite a few light scuffs/scratches, or several more-pronounced
                scratches. This has obviously been played, but not handled as
                carefully as a VG+. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: More
                wear, marks, indentations than a VG+. May have slight fading, a
                small tear/rip, or some writing.

                There are a lot of scuffs/scratches. However it will still play
                through without problems. This has not been handled with much
                care at all. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Well worn,
                marked, more obvious indentations, fading, writing, than a VG -
                possibly a more significant tear/rip.

            <h3>Generic</h3>
            <details>
              <p>
                Within the context of grading items in the GameHub Marketplace,
                the term "generic" refers to a type of sleeve that is not
                specific to the release. A generic sleeve is either a plain
                sleeve or a company sleeve with standard company artwork. A
                sleeve that is graded as "generic" needs no further grading, as
                a generic sleeve generally adds little value to the item and can
                be easily replaced. Sellers can further specify a generic
                sleeve's condition in the “Item condition comment” field if
                needed. A seller can also note if the sleeve is a company sleeve
                in the “Item condition comment” field.
