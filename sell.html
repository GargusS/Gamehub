              with good care - and certainly not
              abused.Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Slight wear, marks,

              Quite a few light scuffs/scratches, or several more-pronounced
              scratches. This has obviously been played, but not handled as
              carefully as a VG+. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: More
              wear, marks, indentations than a VG+. May have slight fading, a
              small tear/rip, or some writing.

              There are a lot of scuffs/scratches. However it will still play
              through without problems. This has not been handled with much
              care at all. Insert/Inlay/Booklet/Sleeve/Digipak: Well worn,
              marked, more obvious indentations, fading, writing, than a VG -
              possibly a more significant tear/rip.

            <p>
              Within the context of grading items in the GameHub Marketplace,
              the term "generic" refers to a type of sleeve that is not
              specific to the release. A generic sleeve is either a plain
              sleeve or a company sleeve with standard company artwork. A
              sleeve that is graded as "generic" needs no further grading, as
              a generic sleeve generally adds little value to the item and can
              be easily replaced. Sellers can further specify a generic
              sleeve's condition in the “Item condition comment” field if
              needed. A seller can also note if the sleeve is a company sleeve
              in the “Item condition comment” field.
